Title: Maps domains to varaibles within a dataset (SAIL databank)
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Rachael Stickland
Maintainer: Rachael Stickland <rstickland@turing.ac.uk>
Description: This function will read in the meta-data of a dataset (DataClass) from the SAIL databank, obtained from https://modelcatalogue.cs.ox.ac.uk/hdruk_live/.
    It will loop through all the variable names, and ask you to categorise each variable into one of your chosen domains.
    The domains (or 'latent concepts') will appear up in the Plots tab for your reference, as well as information about the dataset.
    A log file will be saved with the categorizations you made.
